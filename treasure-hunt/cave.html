	 <h2>The Jounery Through The Dark Cave</h2>

	 <p>You step into the cave, and wondered what's going on. While your wondering the air 
	    turns cool and damp. The shadows dance across the shaky and rocky walls as your heart beats with fear and your torch flickers. Deep inside the cave you notice two tunnels - one glows faintly, while the other echoes with a strange sound. Which path will you take?</p>
